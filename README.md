# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub.
Hello. I am Caleb Long. I am currently 19 years old and a student in college. This is the start to me self-teaching myself programming and software development skills. I am self-teaching because my college does not have a very good program on computer programming, and I feel the only way I can learn without financially burdening myself with college is by teaching myself. I hope for the best, and I am eager to learn more so I can get my career started.
